> _Building a 16-bit computer system from scratch — one gate at a time._

---

## 🚧 Status: Foundations Being Laid

This repo will document the full journey through the **NAND2Tetris** project — from a lone NAND gate to a complete computing platform.

Not just a computer.  
Not just software.  
A full-stack **creation from first principles**.

## 🧩 What’s Coming

- 🧱 **Logic gates** carved from nothing  
- 🧠 **Architecture** born from boolean algebra  
- 📜 **Instructions** etched in assembly  
- 💻 **Software stack** raised from bare metal  
- 🔤 **Compiler** to breathe life into code  
- 🧰 **Operating system**: hand-rolled, low-level, real

## 🌌 Why?

To understand the machine, **become the machine**.  
This is a story in code — unfolding layer by layer.

---

## 🔮 Stay Tuned

The work hasn’t started. But the vision is set.

Clarity comes with construction.  
Silicon dreams await.
